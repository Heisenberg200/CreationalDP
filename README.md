Objectives :
1. Study the Creational Design Patterns

2. Implement them in real projects

Theory :
In software engineering, creational design patterns are design patterns that deal with object creation mechanisms, trying to create objects in a manner suitable to the situation.

The basic form of object creation could result in design problems or added complexity to the design. Creational design patterns solve this problem by somehow controlling this object creation.

Some examples of this kind of design patterns are :

Singleton
Builder
Prototype
Object Pooling
Factory Method
Abstract Factory
Implementation :
In this project I've implemented 3 creational design patterns i.e. ( Builder,  Factory Method and Abstract Factory) with the emphasis on the fundamental object Car.
